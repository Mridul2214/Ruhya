            "Ruh'ya was born from an inner inclination that has been with me for as long as I can remember.",
            "From a very young age, I was naturally drawn to understanding people — their emotions, unspoken dynamics, inner worlds, and the deeper reasons behind behaviour. I was sensitive to atmospheres, relationships, and emotional undercurrents, often noticing what went unsaid. This intuitive awareness was not something I learned; it was something I carried.",
            "As life unfolded, experiences deepened this natural sensitivity and gave it form. I came to understand that emotional awareness, when supported with the right tools, can become a powerful pathway for healing, clarity, and integration — both for oneself and for others.",
            "My journey into therapeutic work was therefore not driven by fixing or searching, but by a growing clarity that this is the language my system understands — working with emotions, the subconscious, the body, creativity, and the unseen layers that shape our lives.",
            "Through both training and practice, I witnessed how many struggles — anxiety, emotional overwhelm, self-doubt, relationship patterns, and inner conflict — are not flaws to be corrected, but signals inviting awareness and compassion. When these signals are met with presence rather than pressure, transformation happens naturally.",
            "Ruh'ya is a space grounded in this understanding. Therapy here is not reserved for moments of crisis. It is for anyone seeking deeper self-connection, emotional regulation, clarity, or growth. You do not need to be broken to begin — you only need to be willing to listen inward.",
            "My approach is collaborative, intuitive, and grounded. I offer a steady, non-judgmental presence, creating space for your nervous system to settle, your emotions to be acknowledged, and your inner wisdom to emerge. Healing, in my experience, is not something we impose — it is something we allow."
